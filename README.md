# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

This webpage is designed to be a review of the lessons learned in the prework for the bootcamp. It was made as a reference material as well as mile marker for my progress while learning to code. This will give me a quick and efficient way to review the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. While creating this website i learned how to apply the listed coding languages to form the structure, styling, and interactivity of a website while maintaining a repository for the sake of learning the git flow for version control.
