        <li>In semantic html elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>

        <li>Element and tag are often used interchangeably but they are different: Element refers to the full element from opening to closing tag, whereas tags refer to only what appears in the angle brackets.</li>
